**Manipulating lists**
        1.You may be familiar with adding individual data elements to a list by using the .append() method. However, if you want to combine a list with another array type(list, set, tuple), you can use the .extend() method on the list.

        2. You can also use the .index() method to find the position of an item in a list. You can then use that position to remove the item with the .pop() method.

        3. In this exercise, you'll practice using all these methods!

        4. Ask 4 students at Datanomics to enter their names one at a time
        
        5.Add their names to the list

student_names = ['Muluken', 'Bethelhem', 'Samuel', 'Workneh']

        6. Extend the list student_names using the .extend() list method with two additional new students 


        7. Print student_names


        8. Find the position of one of the students and store the result in a variable called 'position'
       
position = 2

        9.Remove that student  from the list student_names using the .pop() list method
       

        10. Print student_names one more time

print(student_names)
